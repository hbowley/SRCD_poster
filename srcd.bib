	abstract = {Many studies have confirmed the time-limited involvement of the hippocampus in mnemonic processes and suggested that there is reorganization of the responsible brain circuitry during memory consolidation. To clarify such reorganization, we chose trace classical eyeblink conditioning, in which hippocampal ablation produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia. Here, we extended the temporal characterization of retrograde amnesia to other regions that are involved in acquisition during this task: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the cerebellum. At a various time interval after establishing the trace conditioned response (CR), rats received an aspiration of one of the three regions. After recovery, the animals were tested for their CR retention. When ablated 1 d after the learning, both the hippocampal lesion and the cerebellar lesion group of rats exhibited a severe impairment in retention of the CR, whereas the mPFC lesion group showed only a slight decline. With an increase in interval between the lesion and the learning, the effect of the hippocampal lesion diminished and that of the mPFC lesion increased. When ablated 4 weeks after the learning, the hippocampal lesion group exhibited as robust CRs as its corresponding control group. In contrast, the mPFC lesion and the cerebellar lesion groups failed to retain the CRs. These results indicate that the hippocampus and the cerebellum, but only marginally the mPFC, constitute a brain circuitry that mediates recently acquired memory. As time elapses, the circuitry is reorganized to use mainly the mPFC and the cerebellum, but not the hippocampus, for remotely acquired memory.},

	abstract = {Classical conditioning paradigms, such as trace conditioning, in which a silent period elapses between the offset of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US), and delay conditioning, in which the CS and US coterminate, are widely used to study the neural substrates of associative learning. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the neural systems underlying conditioning in humans. For example, evidence from animal and human patient research suggests that the hippocampus plays a critical role during trace eyeblink conditioning, but there is no evidence to date in humans that the hippocampus is active during trace eyeblink conditioning or is differentially responsive to delay and trace paradigms. The present work provides a direct comparison of the neural correlates of human delay and trace eyeblink conditioning by using functional MRI. Behavioral results showed that humans can learn both delay and trace conditioning in parallel. Comparable delay and trace activation was measured in the cerebellum, whereas greater hippocampal activity was detected during trace compared with delay conditioning. These findings further support the position that the cerebellum is involved in both delay and trace eyeblink conditioning whereas the hippocampus is critical for trace eyeblink conditioning. These results also suggest that the neural circuitry supporting delay and trace eyeblink classical conditioning in humans and laboratory animals may be functionally similar.},

	abstract = {The current study examined the relations between hippocampal structure (e.g., volume and neurite density) and performance on a trace eye blink conditioning (EBC) task in young children. Our first aim assessed whether individual differences in hippocampal volume were associated with trace EBC performance, using both percent Conditioned Responses (\% CR) and CR onset latency or the average latency (ms) at which the child started their blink, as measures of hippocampal-dependent associative learning. Our second aim evaluated whether individual differences in hippocampal neurite density were associated with EBC performance using the same outcome measures. Typically developing 4- to 6-year-olds (N = 31; 14 girls; Mage = 5.67; SDage = 0.89) completed T1 and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and a 15-minute trace eyeblink conditioning task outside of the scanner. \% CR and CR onset latency were computed across all tone-puff and tone-alone trials. While hippocampal volume was not associated with any of our EBC measures, greater hippocampal neurite density bilaterally, was associated with later CR onset. In other words, children with greater left and right hippocampal neurite density blinked closer to the US (i.e., air puff) than children with less hippocampal neurite density, indicating that structural changes in the hippocampus assisted in the accurate timing of conditioned responses.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus is a subcortical structure in the medial temporal lobe involved in cognitive functions such as spatial navigation and reorientation, episodic memory, and associative learning. While much is understood about the role of hippocampal function in learning and memory in adults, less is known about the relations between the hippocampus and the development of these cognitive skills in young children due to the limitations of using standard methods (e.g., MRI) to examine brain structure and function in developing populations. This study used hippocampal-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) as a feasible approach to examine individual differences in hippocampal functioning as they relate to spatial reorientation and episodic memory performance in young children. Three- to six-year-old children (N = 50) completed tasks that measured EBC, spatial reorientation, and episodic memory, as well as non-hippocampal-dependent processing speed abilities. Results revealed that when age was held constant, individual differences in EBC performance were significantly related to individual differences in performance on the spatial reorientation test, but not on the episodic memory or processing speed tests. When the relations between hippocampal-dependent EBC and different reorientation strategies were explored, it was found that individual differences in hippocampal function predicted the use of geometric information for reorienting in space as opposed to a combined strategy that uses both geometric information and salient visual cues. The utilization of eyeblink conditioning to examine hippocampal function in young populations and its implications for understanding the dissociation between spatial reorientation and episodic memory development are discussed.},
